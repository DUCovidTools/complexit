#### **Summary**

The data used for running our classification methods come from [Public Health England](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) and [Public Health Italy](http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1). As the case curve evolves over the next year, we will continue to use the previous set of months for our predictions. Also, given that Public Health England recommends caution on any given week from using the most recent cumulative incidence rates, we model the current date of download, minus the most recent day. Because the Italian provinces started roughly two weeks ahead of the outbreak in the UK (and also post-lockdown strategies for easing social distancing), they offer a short-term forecast for their matching authority districts in the North East and North Yorkshire region.
