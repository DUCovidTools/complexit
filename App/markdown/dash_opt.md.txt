### Dashboard options

For the selected North East region, the plot shows the cumulative number of confirmed cases, along with the corresponding data from those Italian regions in the same cluster that are close enough (fitting within the 'range for proxy' on the last day of UK data). Because of the assumption that Italy is two weeks ahead of the UK, the Italian data provides a heuristic forecast for the North East region.

Selecting 'Show numbers' will display the smallest and largest values from this selection of proxy data, for each day.

'Show UK data from same cluster' will add the data from those regions in the UK in the same cluster as the selected North East region.

'Show estimate' will display an estimated forecast, derived from the past week of data for the chosen region. This estimate does not use data from any other UK or Italian region.
