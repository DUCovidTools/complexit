### Estimate

If the option 'Show estimate' is selected, the past week's data from the region is used to form an estimate in the following way.

1. The gradient within the past week's data is found.
2. This gradient is used to extrapolate from the current day. 
  * The gradient is multiplied by a factor of 0.9 for the minimum, and 1.1 for the maximum.
  * The minimum is projected from the actual number of cases on the current day.
  * The maximum is projected from 1.1 times that number of cases.
